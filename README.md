## 🔍 The Insight

You're applying to dozens of jobs. Each JD feels unique, but **what if you could see the pattern?**

- 📥 **Collect** job descriptions you're interested in
- 🔮 **Discover** which skills appear most frequently  
- 🎯 **Understand** what truly matters in your dream role

**FeedMeJD** reveals the hidden blueprint by aggregating insights across all your saved jobs—turning scattered requirements into crystal-clear priorities.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

**1. Browse LinkedIn jobs** as you normally would  
A friendly pet appears on every job description page.

**2. Feed interesting JDs to your pet**  
Click once. The pet "digests" the JD using on-device AI (Gemini Nano), extracting key skills.

**3. Open your Skill Gallery**  
After collecting a few gems, open the dashboard to see:
- Which skills appear most often across your saved jobs
- What hard vs. soft skills dominate your target role
- How different skills relate to each other

**The more you feed, the clearer your blueprint becomes.**
