### **Application Name**
FeedMeJD

### **Elevator Pitch**
Hi there! 👋

Let's be honest: reading job descriptions can feel like trying to see the stars in a big city. You know the key skills are in there, but they're lost in the noise of corporate buzzwords and endless bullet points. 

What if you could clear the noise and see your career path written in the stars? That's FeedMeJD. It's your personal AI cartographer, mapping your professional DNA from the jobs you *actually* care about.

### **The Problem You Are Looking to Solve**
Are you building spreadsheets to track job requirements? If so, we need to talk. 😉

Manually tracking skills across dozens of JDs is a recipe for burnout. You're trying to find a signal in the noise, but you end up just staring at a wall of text, wondering: *what's the real pattern here?* It feels like flying blind.

### **Our Solution**
What if you could stop guessing and start *seeing*? FeedMeJD doesn't just analyze a single JD; it helps you build a personal intelligence map of your entire job search.

As you browse LinkedIn, you simply "feed" interesting jobs to a cute AI pet. Behind the scenes, it's collecting, connecting, and decoding the hidden patterns. After just a few "meals," you unlock your **Skill Blueprint**—a living, breathing visualization of the skills that define your path. Suddenly, the way forward becomes clear.

### **Features and Functionality**
-   **Your Job-Hunting Pet**: A fun, zero-friction way to collect JDs without ever leaving LinkedIn. Just click, and your pet does the rest.
-   **The Skill Blueprint**: This is your new command center. See which skills are truly in-demand for your target roles, brought to life in four beautiful, interactive ways (Word Cloud, Constellation, Prism, and Galaxy).
-   **Discover Hidden Connections**: Our experimental "Galaxy" view maps how skills relate to each other. Ever wonder if "Python" roles also demand "AWS"? Now you can see it.
-   **Your Data, Your Device. Period.**: All AI analysis happens on your machine. Your career ambitions are yours alone. We think that's how it should be.

### **APIs Used**
We built FeedMeJD to push the limits of what's possible with on-device AI. The magic is powered by **Gemini Nano**, accessed seamlessly and securely through the **`chrome.ai` Prompt API**. It’s fast, incredibly private, and it just works—no servers needed.
